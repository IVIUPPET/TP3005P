# TP3005P

This is software copied verbatim from the works of Richard A. Zwicky, Jr. on
this blog:

I purchased one of these just because it had this nice open-source starting
point, but for open source software to grow and spread, it needs the visibility
and ease of collalboration that comes only with version control software such
as Git/Github/Bitbucket etc. 

I cannot make my repos private to work on this, so it is public. But it does
not make sense for me to work on this without it being contained in a git repo.
